Simple Graph lib:
---
Should support 2 types of graphs - directed and undirected with 3 operations:
- addVertex - adds vertex to the graph
- addEdge - adds edge to the graph
- getPath - returns a list of edges between 2 vertices (path doesnâ€™t have to be optimal)
Vertices should be of a user defined type.

## Implemented optional requirements
-  Make you graphs thread safe.
-  Add traverse function that will take a user defined function and apply it on every vertex of the graph.

## Not implemented optional requirements
-  Add weighted edges support in your lib.
